Islam-Expo
==========
Islam-Expo is an event that portrays Islamic culture and
Islam. The event, now organized for the third time, has
grown into a three-day event and is hoped to attract a
bigger audience than the previous ones. The main organizer
of the event is the Islamic Council of Finland, the
umbrella organization for Finnish Islamic organizations.

The goal of the event is to promote cooperation between
Muslims and the Finnish society, to bring Muslim organizations
together and to help them develop. In addition, the
aim is to foster a stronger foundation for being a Muslim
in Finland, demystify Islam, prevent and correct myths and
prejudices against Islam and Muslims and promote multiculturalism
in Finalnd.

Islam-Expo is targeted for both Muslims and the general
public. Friday´s programme is designed for the general
public, officials and different sections of the society and
the focus is on the social and political aspects of Islam. On
Saturday and Sunday, the focus is more on Islam itself and
on other themes that are of interest to Finnish Muslims.
There is also programme for children so that families can
attend the Expo together.
